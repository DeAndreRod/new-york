         <h2>This is the Big apple, the city that never sleeps.</h2>
         <p>New york is very diverse. There arent many activites that you can think of that you would not find in this beautiful city. Here are just a couple of activites that I love to do.</p>

       <p>First activity I really enjoy is visiting the Museum of Natural History in New York City. The planetarium is my favorite attraction. </p>

        <p>Another activity I really enjoy doing is Hiking! This park is only 45 minutes away from the city in a town called West Harrison and it is worth the trip. The many routes you can take on your hiking journey and scenery that just compliments the whole experience is something I recommend doing if you find yourself in those parts.</p>

      <div>
        <p>This is the Last but definitely not least. I love food! New York is very diverse and if there is something you are craving, I'm willing to bet New York has it and as authentic as if you were at the country itself.</p>

         <p>Oh my oh my. I love food, and no matter where I travel to, I never seem to find food more authentic the in New York. Chinatown is where I have tasted the best chinese food in my life. The second photo is one of my favorite foods to eat that comes from a street vendor named The Halal Guys. This is New York so I had to include some street meat.</p>
